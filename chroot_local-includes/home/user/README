        Welcome to Project Jamie, and thank you for trying out our distribution.  Currently,
we're in a pre-alpha release stage, and we're often adding new features and improving old
ones.  This guide is intended to be a short "quick start guide" and is by no means a complete
documentation.

In this guide we'll quickly cover a few simple topics:

        - Setting up your cluster
        - Compiling and running your first MPI program
        - Running a benchmark on your cluster using John the Ripper MPI

**Setting Up Your Cluster**
***************************

        After booting all of your nodes, you will find yourself on each node in the home directory,
just as you would in other linux distributions.  Setting up your master nodes and slave nodes is a
simple and painless process where you will pass arguments to a single script called "configurejamie."


**Configuring the Master Node** 

        The first thing you will need to decide is which node you would like to be your master, node.  
For simplicity's sake, you may find it easiest to choose the most powerful node at your disposal.

        Once you have chosen a node to be the master, you will type the following command:
        
                configurejamie master

        This command will add the master to the "nodes" list, and it will print the ip address of
the node to the screen. This address is important for setting up the slave nodes.  The command should
finish quickly.  Assuming all went well, congratulations, you've just set up your first node!


**Configuring the Slave Nodes**

        After the configuration of the master/head node is complete, setting up the slaves is easy as
well.  Using the IP address that the master node configuration told you, run this command:

                configurejamie slave [ip address of master]
                
        This will ssh into the master node, append the slave's ip address to the nodes list, and mount
the master's home directory as an nfs drive.  You'll receive a message stating that the node is ready
after all of these tasks are done.
