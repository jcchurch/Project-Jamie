Hello. This is Project Jamie.

This distribution of Linux allows people to quickly convert a
heterogeneous collection of machines into a cluster computer.
Since this distro is also a Live CD, there is no software to
install on the cluster nodes.

The latest version is called "Outerz0ne 7 Build"
(since this was the most recent conference where this work was
demonstrated.)

Note: This distro is preconfigured with SSH keys so that any
copy of the distro can immediately reach any other copy of
this distro without the need for a password. This is an open
security door, which means you should run your cluster behind
a firewall. You have been warned.

===================================
For the rushed:
===================================

- sudo apt-get install live-helper qemu cdrecord
- make
- (Stick a CD into the computer.)
- cdrecord -v -eject livecd/binary.iso # Repeat this step multiple times.
- Boot each computer in your new cluster using the Project Jamie Live CD.
- Run the command "configurejamie master" on the desired master node. Note the IP address.
- Run the command "configurejamie slave IP_ADDRESS" on each of the slave nodes.

===================================
How to build and execute the project:
===================================

Step 0: Preparing to build the project.

Required elements for this project:
(i.e. Better get these programs before you begin)

 - Debian Live Magic
 - cdrecord (For burning the ISO to a CD)
 - qemu (For running the ISO in a virtual machine.)
 - An Internet Connection
 - About 5-30 minutes depending on your Internet connection.

To get everything in one step:

$ sudo apt-get install live-helper qemu cdrecord

Step 1: Build the project.

Our build script is Makefile. To execute it, run this command:

$ make

Step 2: Burn the iso and boot the Live CD --OR-- Launch the distro as a virtual machine.

To burn the ISO:

$ cdrecord -v -eject livecd/binary.iso

To launch the ISO as a virtual machine:

$ sudo sh runNodeInQEMU.sh 46

(Here, the 46 represents the last two digits of the MAC address. Each MAC address must be different.)

Step 3: Configure the cluster.

For each computer (or virtual machine), pick one to be the master node. Run this command on that machine:

$ configurejamie master

This should report on the screen the IP address. Write this down. On each of the slaves, run this command:

$ configurejamie slave IP_ADDRESS_OF_MASTER

You now have a super computer.
