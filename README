Hello. This is Project Jamie.

This distribution of Linux allows people to quickly convert a
heterogeneous collection of machines into a cluster computer.
Since this distro is also a Live CD, there is no software to
install on the cluster nodes.

The latest version is called "Indiana Linux Fest Build" (version 0.8)
(since this was the most recent conference where this work was
demonstrated.)

Note: This distro is preconfigured with SSH keys so that any
copy of the distro can immediately reach any other copy of
this distro without the need for a password. This is an open
security door, which means you should run your cluster behind
a firewall. You have been warned.

===================================
For the rushed:
===================================

- sudo apt-get install live-helper qemu cdrecord
- make
- (Stick a CD into the computer.)
- cdrecord -v -eject livecd/binary.iso # Repeat this step multiple times.
- Boot each computer in your new cluster using the Project Jamie Live CD.
- Run the command "configurejamie master" on the desired master node. Note the IP address.
- Run the command "configurejamie slave IP_ADDRESS" on each of the slave nodes.

===================================
How to build and execute the project:
===================================

Step 0: Preparing to build the project.

Required elements for this project:
(i.e. Better get these programs before you begin)

 - Debian Live Magic
 - cdrecord (For burning the ISO to a CD)
 - qemu (For running the ISO in a virtual machine.)
 - An Internet Connection
 - About 5-30 minutes depending on your Internet connection.

To get everything in one step:

$ sudo apt-get install live-helper qemu cdrecord

Step 1: Build the project.

Our build script is a Makefile. To execute it, run this command:

$ make

Step 2: Burn the iso and boot the Live CD --OR-- Launch the distro as a virtual machine.

To burn the ISO:

$ cdrecord -v -eject livecd/binary.iso

To launch the ISO as a virtual machine:

$ sudo sh runNodeInQEMU.sh 46

(Here, the 46 represents the last two digits of the MAC address. Each MAC address must be different.)

Step 3: Configure the cluster.

For each computer (or virtual machine), pick one to be the master node. Run this command on that machine:

$ configurejamie master

This should report on the screen the IP address. Write this down. On each of the slaves, run this command:

$ configurejamie slave IP_ADDRESS_OF_MASTER

You now have a cluster computer.
